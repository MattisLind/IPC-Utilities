This directory contains utilities for reading filesystem for the HP
Integral Personal Computer.  These utilities may also work for other
HP-UX obsolete filesystems as well, but I have not tested them on
anything other than an IPC.  These utilities should not work for any
modern UNIX file systems.  If they do, then you should store your data
somewhere else.

Currently, this program has only been compiled for Sun Solaris 7. If
you modify this software, please provide me with the changes so that I
can incorporate them back into the original.

Also, some of the include files are copyright by HP. I would like to
distribute a clean version of this code, so if anyone would like to
rewrite those, I would incorporate that as well.

To install, you need GNU make or you must compile by hand. The tools
should compile on most UNIX systems. I have compiled sucessfully on
Solaris 7 and OpenBSD. You will need gcc or a compiler with an alloca
function - this shouldn't be too hard to find.

Please let me know if you find this software useful or have any
feedback for me.

Thanks,
